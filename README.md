# Horiseon-challenge1-getting-up-to-accessibility-standards

<h2>Project Description - For bootcamp challenge 1:<h2> 

<h3>making the codebase of Horiseon up to accessibility standards by making sure it follows semantic structure, code is logical and purposeful, is consolidated and annotated so that it is optimised for search engines.
This code is a landing page for a hypothetical search engine optimiation company.
The main challenge of this codebase for me at this stage in time was figuring out how to change parts of HTML file while still keeping the affects of the CSS file counterparts in effect and thus has has made me seek a deeper understanding of the relation and effects of HTML and CSS on one and other.<h3>
