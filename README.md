# Horiseon-challenge1-getting-up-to-accessibility-standards

<h2>Project Description - For bootcamp challenge 1:<h2> 

<h3>making the codebase of Horiseon up to accessibility standards by making sure it follows semantic structure, code is logical and purposeful, is consolidated and annotated so that it is optimised for search engines.
This code is a landing page for a hypothetical search engine optimiation company.
The main challenge of this codebase for me at this stage in time was figuring out how to change parts of HTML file while still keeping the affects of the CSS file counterparts in effect and thus has has made me seek a deeper understanding of the relation and effects of HTML and CSS on one and other.<h3>


<h2>No installation is required.<h2>

<h2>Additional Credits - <h3>The Sydney University Bootcamp is responsible for providing the initial layout of the page and design of it as well as the project direction.<h3>


<h2>How to use:<h2>

<h3>The project can be used to test ways to improve how you consolidate code and also to see how HTML and CSS interact with eachother on a page together. There are notes on what the CSS selectors do to the page.
